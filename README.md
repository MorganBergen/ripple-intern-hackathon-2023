# XRPL Intelligence

Discord AI chatbot trained on XRPL Documentation and shared in a discord channel for XRPL developers to learn more about the XRPL ecosystem.


###  Front-end:  Discord Bot

The Discord bot serves as the front-end in our application.  It's responsible for receiving messages from users in the Discord channel, handling user interactions, and sending responses back to the channel.

###  Back-end:  Python Scripts

The python script acts as the back-end.  It's responsible for processing the user's questions, querying the openai api to generate responses, and provides the response back to the discord bot.
